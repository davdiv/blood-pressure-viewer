# Blood Pressure Viewer

This repository contains a web application that allows to extract blood pressure measures from a bluetooth blood pressure monitor, to show them graphically and as a list, and to save them in a JSON or CSV file. It is also possible to load a previously saved JSON file.

Data is processed directly in the local web browser and is not sent to any remote server.

This application is directly usable [online here](https://davdiv.github.io/blood-pressure-viewer/)

It uses the <a href="https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/">Web Bluetooth API</a>.
